## Background
Nowadays, to learn and stay sharp with current edge of technology is very challenging.
In this repository i have put my Proof Of Concept about Event Planner
with ReactJS as main technology and NodeJs Express as main API. 

We plan to use Microservices (Service Oriented Architecture) - so all module 
will have less dependency and with React Component it makes system can be extend or reuse easily.
Off course with API we can integrate it With Mobile apps as well. (Either native or ReactNative) 

Current objective : Event Planner v0.0.3
